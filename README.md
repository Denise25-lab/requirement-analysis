The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.
“What is Requirement Analysis?”
Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are identified, examined, and documented to define what a software system must do.

In simple terms, it’s the process of understanding “what the system should do” before writing any code.

Key Points:

Purpose:

To gather and clarify stakeholder needs.

To define the scope of the system.

To prevent misunderstandings and reduce the risk of building the wrong system.

Activities Involved:

Requirement Gathering/Elicitation: Collecting needs via interviews, surveys, workshops.

Requirement Analysis: Refining and prioritizing gathered requirements.

Requirement Documentation: Writing detailed specifications (e.g., SRS – Software Requirements Specification).

Requirement Validation: Ensuring requirements are complete, feasible, and approved by stakeholders.

Types of Requirements:

Functional Requirements: What the system should do (e.g., search properties, book tickets).

Non-Functional Requirements: How the system should perform (e.g., security, performance, usability).

Importance:

Defines project scope and prevents scope creep.

Helps allocate resources effectively.

Provides a clear blueprint for designers, developers, and testers.

In short, requirement analysis ensures that the final software meets user needs and expectations efficiently.
