The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.
“What is Requirement Analysis?”
Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are identified, examined, and documented to define what a software system must do.

In simple terms, it’s the process of understanding “what the system should do” before writing any code.

Key Points:

Purpose:

To gather and clarify stakeholder needs.

To define the scope of the system.

To prevent misunderstandings and reduce the risk of building the wrong system.

Activities Involved:

Requirement Gathering/Elicitation: Collecting needs via interviews, surveys, workshops.

Requirement Analysis: Refining and prioritizing gathered requirements.

Requirement Documentation: Writing detailed specifications (e.g., SRS – Software Requirements Specification).

Requirement Validation: Ensuring requirements are complete, feasible, and approved by stakeholders.

Types of Requirements:

Functional Requirements: What the system should do (e.g., search properties, book tickets).

Non-Functional Requirements: How the system should perform (e.g., security, performance, usability).

Importance:

Defines project scope and prevents scope creep.

Helps allocate resources effectively.

Provides a clear blueprint for designers, developers, and testers.

In short, requirement analysis ensures that the final software meets user needs and expectations efficiently.
“Why is Requirement Analysis Important?”
Here are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC:

1. Defines Clear Project Scope

Requirement analysis helps identify what the system should and shouldn’t do.

By clearly defining the scope, it prevents scope creep, where unplanned features are added during development.

Example: Knowing upfront that a property booking system should allow searching and booking but not manage payments avoids confusion later.

2. Reduces Development Risks and Costs

Identifying requirements early helps detect inconsistencies, missing features, or unrealistic expectations before coding begins.

Fixing problems during development or after release is much more expensive than during analysis.

Example: Discovering that the system must handle thousands of simultaneous users before development avoids costly redesigns.

3. Improves Communication and Stakeholder Satisfaction

Requirement analysis ensures that all stakeholders (clients, users, developers) have a shared understanding of what the system will deliver.

Proper documentation and validation prevent misunderstandings and ensure expectations are met.

Example: Using requirement specifications or user stories keeps developers aligned with what the client wants.

“Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.”
1. Requirement Gathering

Definition: Collecting information about what stakeholders need from the system.

Purpose: To capture all necessary data and expectations from users, clients, and other stakeholders.

Techniques: Interviews, surveys, questionnaires, observation, and reviewing existing documentation.

Example: Asking property owners and renters what features they need in a property booking system.

2. Requirement Elicitation

Definition: Actively refining, clarifying, and exploring the gathered requirements.

Purpose: To dig deeper into the requirements and uncover implicit needs or constraints that stakeholders may not have articulated.

Techniques: Brainstorming sessions, workshops, prototyping, use case analysis.

Example: Using mockups of the booking system to help stakeholders visualize features and provide more detailed feedback.

3. Requirement Documentation

Definition: Creating formal documents that clearly describe the requirements.

Purpose: To provide a reference that developers, testers, and stakeholders can agree on.

Common Formats: Software Requirements Specification (SRS), user stories, use cases.

Example: Writing an SRS that specifies login functionality, property search filters, and booking confirmation process.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling

Definition: Examining and organizing requirements to ensure they are feasible, complete, consistent, and unambiguous.

Purpose: To transform raw requirements into structured formats that can guide design and development.

Techniques: Creating diagrams (ER diagrams, flowcharts), prioritizing requirements, resolving conflicts.

Example: Drawing a data flow diagram showing how user input flows through the booking system to the database.

5. Requirement Validation

Definition: Reviewing and confirming that documented requirements meet stakeholder needs and are implementable.

Purpose: To ensure requirements are correct, complete, and agreed upon before development begins.

Techniques: Walkthroughs, inspections, reviews, prototyping, and formal approval from stakeholders.

Example: Conducting a review session where the client verifies that the documented booking workflow matches their expectations.
“Types of Requirements.”
1. Functional Requirements

Definition: Functional requirements specify what the system should do—the tasks, functions, or features the system must perform. They describe the system’s behavior and interactions with users or other systems.

Examples for a Booking Management System:

Feature	Description
User Registration/Login	Users must be able to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
Property Search	Users should be able to search for properties using filters like location, price, and type.
Booking Functionality	Users must be able to book a property for a specified date range.
Payment Processing	The system should process payments securely via integrated payment gateways.
Booking Cancellation	Users should be able to cancel bookings according to the cancellation policy.
2. Non-functional Requirements

Definition: Non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform rather than what it does. They focus on system qualities like performance, security, reliability, and usability.

Examples for a Booking Management System:

Quality	Description
Performance	The system should handle 5000 concurrent users without slowdowns.
Security	All user data and payment information must be encrypted.
Reliability	The system should have 99.9% uptime to ensure bookings are always accessible.
Usability	The interface should be intuitive, enabling users to complete a booking in 3 steps.
Scalability	The system must support expansion to new regions without major redesign.

“Use Case Diagrams.”
Use Case Diagram is a visual representation of a system’s functional requirements, showing how users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases). It’s part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
Key Elements:

Actors: Entities that interact with the system (e.g., users, admins).

Use Cases: Actions or services the system provides (e.g., “Book Property”).

System Boundary: The scope of the system, usually drawn as a rectangle.

Relationships: Lines showing interactions between actors and use cases.

Benefits:

Clarity: Provides a clear picture of system functionality and user interactions.

Communication: Helps developers, stakeholders, and testers understand requirements quickly.

Requirement Validation: Ensures all functional requirements are captured and can be reviewed.

Foundation for Design: Guides developers in designing the system architecture and workflows.
